# teleport-webpack-react
This is a template from the app https://github.com/snipsco/teleport that helps you to build a setup to build a cool bundled react app with a flask-websocketer

You can test yourself with
```
tpt -c --project my-app --templates teleport-flask-websocketer,teleport-webpack-react,teleport-snips
```
and then follow these instructions https://github.com/snipsco/teleport/blob/master/README.md#start-a-new-project

See for instance how this was used to build our benchmark dashboard https://github.com/snipsco/snips-sdk-benchmark
